<p id="blue"> Who We Are</p>
<p>Hello, my name is Katherine McBean and this site is the product of my dream becoming a reality. During my sophomore year of college, I got the idea to start a graphic tshirt company. Artistic esxpression has always been one of the ways in which I cope with the stress of balancing school and everyday life. One day, I decided to no longer store this idea in the back of my head, but to actually put it on paper. Recently, I decided to take my vision one step further, and now I donate 60% of the profits of my retail to charity. Life hs given me so much, and I knew it was my turn to start giving back. So, will you join me today in doing the same? I hope you find something that speaks to you, to your soul, your personal style, I hope you find at least one item that you can be proud to wear and that helps show off the beautiful, unique individual that you are. So treat yourself, you deserve it.</p>
<p>One feature that I've added as of late is a design your own option.</p>
<p>Sell custom t-shirts and take donations with no inventory, hassles or risk. Just design your shirt, share why you are raising and then share your campaign. We fill the orders and send along the funds you raise!</p>
<p>xoxo,</p>
<p>Kit-Kat</p>
